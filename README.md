# Admin Menu for Admin-Pro 1.00

This is a admin rcon menu for mod admin-pro. It will work for SH, BT 
and AA. It is a client mod and does not go in your server. Inside the zip file
you will find the following:

admin_menu ( folder)
Ådmin_menu.pk3 ( pack file)


Both the folder and the file go in your main dir. THis is either main for 
AA maintt for BT or Mainta for Spearhead.


Once you have installed the menu. open up the folder admin_menu and find the file rconpassword.cfg. 
Open this file with any text editor, like notepad. Place your rcon password in this file.
Each time the menu is opened the rcon password file will set your rcon. If you do not set it in here
your password will be cleared everytime you open the menu.
